1.Fixed Time Slice Scheduler Using Timer Interrupts on Arduino Uno
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Fixed Time Slice (FTS) Scheduler on an Arduino Uno using the AVR ATmega328P microcontroller. It showcases how to configure timer interrupts to create a precise time base for simple real-time task scheduling.

üìã Description
Timer interrupts are used to create a consistent time base using one of the Arduino Uno's hardware timers.

An Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is triggered at fixed intervals (the time slice, TTS) to simulate a basic real-time operating system scheduler.

A global counter (TTS_counter) is incremented in the ISR to keep track of time slices.

The FTS Scheduler function is called within the ISR and uses the counter value to determine which task function to execute (e.g., toggling an LED, reading a sensor, etc.).

Tasks are scheduled in a round-robin or time-sliced manner, ensuring each task runs at predictable and fixed intervals.

The system behavior (e.g., blinking LED) can be verified using an oscilloscope to observe the precise timing.

üîß Features
Configurable Timer1 interrupt setup (CTC mode).

Simple real-time scheduling logic.

Deterministic task switching based on counter values.

Modular task implementation for extensibility.

üìà Use Case

2. PWM Motor Control with FreeRTOS on Arduino Uno
This project demonstrates how to generate and use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals to control a motor model (RC low-pass filter), while leveraging FreeRTOS to manage tasks in a real-time environment on an Arduino Uno.

üìã Description
The project explores how PWM works and how it can be used to control the speed of a motor (or simulate one using an RC low-pass filter).

FreeRTOS, a lightweight real-time operating system, is used to schedule tasks instead of traditional time-slice scheduling.

Multiple tasks (such as setting PWM values, monitoring input, or adjusting duty cycle) are run in a multi-tasking environment using FreeRTOS features such as vTaskDelay(), priorities, and task creation.

The RC filter acts as a first-order low-pass filter, converting the digital PWM signal into an analog-like voltage, simulating motor behavior.

This setup allows for analysis of the response characteristics and timing behavior of PWM-controlled systems in both hardware and software.

üîß Features
PWM signal generation using Arduino analogWrite() or direct timer register configuration.

Motor model simulated using an RC circuit to visualize filtering behavior of PWM.

FreeRTOS task creation, delays, and priority-based scheduling.

Comparison between delay() (blocking) and vTaskDelay() (non-blocking, RTOS-aware).

Discussion of jitter, CPU load, and resource usage with and without RTOS.

Practical application of theoretical concepts like time constants (œÑ), duty cycle calculation, and real-time scheduling.

üìà Educational Value
Understanding how PWM signals can be used to drive analog-like behavior in motors.

Experimenting with task scheduling algorithms: Fixed Time Slice (FTS), Fixed Priority Preemptive (FPP), etc.

Learning how RC low-pass filters smooth out PWM signals.

Gaining hands-on experience with FreeRTOS in an embedded system context.

Evaluating the trade-offs between bare-metal scheduling and RTOS-based implementations.

3.Ping-Pong Task Scheduling with FreeRTOS on Keil LPC4357 (ARM Cortex-M0/M4)
This real-time programming lab demonstrates the implementation of a Ping-Pong task scheme using FreeRTOS on the Keil LPC4357 evaluation board, which features a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller. The project emphasizes Fixed Priority Preemptive (FPP) scheduling, semaphores, and task synchronization.

üìã Project Overview
Three FreeRTOS tasks are implemented:
